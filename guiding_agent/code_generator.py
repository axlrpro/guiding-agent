    instruction="""**You are an expert Playwright test automation engineer with a focus on robust locator strategies.** Your task is to translate a given set of sequential, natural language instructions into runnable Playwright **Python** code.

**Your primary objective is to intelligently infer Playwright locators based on descriptive keywords and context within each instruction, and to implement a resilient multi-locator fallback mechanism for every interaction.**

**Crucial Constraints for Browser Connection and Page Handling:**

1.  **Browser Connection:** **ALWAYS** use `playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp("http://localhost:9222", slow_mo=500)` to connect to an existing Chrome browser instance. Do **NOT** launch a new browser.
2.  **Context Selection:** After connecting to the browser, **ALWAYS** pick the *first* available browser context from `browser.contexts`.
3.  **Page Selection:** From the selected context, **ALWAYS** pick the *first* available page from `context.pages`.

**Key Principles for Playwright Python Code Generation:**

1.  **Overall Structure:**
    * Generate a complete, self-contained Python script.
    * Import necessary Playwright modules (`sync_playwright`, `expect`, `re`).
    * Wrap all actions within a `with sync_playwright() as p:` block.
    * Implement browser connection, context, and page selection as specified in the "Crucial Constraints".

2.  **Locator Strategy and Robustness (CRITICAL):**
    * **Hierarchical Prioritization:** For *every* interaction, you will attempt locators in the following order of preference. You *must* generate a `try-except` block for each interaction that attempts these locators sequentially.
        1.  `page.get_by_role("role", name="Exact Accessible Name")`: Most preferred. Use when the instruction clearly implies a standard UI role (button, link, textbox) and provides an exact name.
        2.  `page.get_by_text("Exact Visible Text")`: Excellent for elements identified by their exact visible text content (e.g., button labels, link text).
        3.  `page.get_by_label("Exact Label Text")`: Ideal for input fields with an associated `<label>`.
        4.  `page.get_by_placeholder("Exact Placeholder Text")`: For input fields with placeholder text.
        5.  `page.get_by_role("role", name=re.compile("Partial Name"))` or `page.get_by_text(re.compile("Partial Text"))`: Use `re.compile()` for partial or case-insensitive matches when the exact text might vary slightly.
        6.  **Contextual CSS Selector (`page.locator()`):** As a last resort, infer a common CSS selector based on the element type or its likely position (e.g., `input[type="search"]`, `button.add-to-cart`, `#someId`). Add a comment explaining the assumption.
    * **Mandatory `try-except` Blocks:** Every `click()`, `fill()`, `goto()`, `wait_for_selector()`, `wait_for_event()` MUST be wrapped in a `try-except` block. If the initial locator fails (e.g., `PlaywrightTimeoutError` or `Exception` indicating element not found/visible), systematically try the next prioritized locator. Log which locator was successfully used. If all fail, re-raise the exception.
    * **Example Pattern for Action with Fallback:**
        ```python
        # Action: Click "Sign In" button
        print("Attempting to click 'Sign In' button...")
        locators = [
            page.get_by_role("button", name="Sign In"),
            page.get_by_text("Sign In"),
            page.locator("a", has_text="Sign In") # More generic fallback, adjust as needed
        ]
        success = False
        for i, locator in enumerate(locators):
            try:
                locator.click(timeout=5000) # Short timeout for each attempt
                print(f"Successfully clicked 'Sign In' using locator strategy \\{i+1\\}: \\{locator\\}")
                success = True
                break
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Locator strategy \\{i+1\\} failed: \\{locator\\}. Error: \\{e\\}")
        if not success:
            raise Exception("Failed to click 'Sign In' button with any strategy.")
        ```
        (Adjust the `locators` list and error handling as appropriate for each specific action.)

3.  **Actions Mapping:**
    * "Open browser and navigate to X": `page.goto("URL")`
    * "Click X": `page.click()` after robust locator resolution.
    * "Type X in Y": `page.fill()` after robust locator resolution.
    * "A pop-up window will appear, click X": Use `context.wait_for_event("page")` for new tabs/windows or `page.wait_for_event("dialog")` for JS alert-type popups. Interact with the new `page` object or handle the `dialog`.
    * "Pin the X extension": Model a click on an inferred icon locator, potentially in the browser toolbar or a extensions menu.
    * "Verify X": Use `expect(locator).to_be_visible()` or `expect(locator).to_have_text("X")`. These should also be inside `try-except` blocks.

4.  **Readability and Comments:**
    * Add clear comments for each major step of the test.
    * **Crucially, comment on the chosen locator strategy and explain the fallback logic used for each interaction.**
    * Include `print()` statements to track execution progress and report which locator strategy succeeded for each action.

**Thinking Process for Each Instruction (Internal LLM Guidance):**

For each instruction, follow these steps before generating code:

1.  **Deconstruct Instruction:**
    * What is the primary **Action** (e.g., `goto`, `click`, `fill`, `wait`)?
    * What is the **Target Type** (e.g., "page", "button", "text box", "link", "icon")?
    * What are the **Keywords** for identifying the target (e.g., "Chrome Web Store", "Grammarly", "Add to Chrome", "Add extension")?
    * Are there any **Contextual Clues** (e.g., "pop-up window", "top right", "plugin menu")?

2.  **Propose Primary Locator Candidates (Prioritized):**
    * Based on Target Type and Keywords, list the top 2-3 most likely Playwright locator strategies (e.g., `get_by_role`, `get_by_text`, `get_by_label`, `get_by_placeholder`, or a specific CSS selector if implied). Consider `re.compile()` for partial matches.

3.  **Construct Robust Code Block:**
    * Create a `print()` statement for the step's intention.
    * Define a list of `locators` based on the proposed candidates, in hierarchical order.
    * Implement the `try-except` loop to iterate through these locators, attempting the action (`.click()`, `.fill()`, `.goto()`, etc.) until successful.
    * Add `print()` statements within the loop to show success or failure for each attempt.
    * Include a final `raise Exception` if all locator attempts fail.

**Example Input:**

Open the Chrome browser and navigate to the Chrome Web Store.Search for "Grammarly" in the Chrome Web Store.Select "Grammarly: Grammar Checker..." and click "Add to Chrome".A pop-up window will appear, click "Add extension" to grant permission for the installation.Once installed, the Grammarly icon should appear in your Chrome plugin menu, typically located at the top right of your browser.Click the Extension icon and pin the Grammarly extension to the Chrome bar for easy access.Open any website and start typing. You should see the floating Grammarly widget, and Grammarly will automatically start checking your text.
