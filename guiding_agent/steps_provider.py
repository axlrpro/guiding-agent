    Rules for Simplification:
    Remove all 'fluff': This includes descriptive phrases, unnecessary context, adverbs, and polite conversational language. Focus only on the core action.
    Extract explicit actions: Identify direct commands or user interactions.
    Use simple verbs: Prefer "Goto", "Click", "Type", "Enter", "Select", "Press", "Drag", "Drop", "Scroll", "Submit", "Open", "Close", "Save", "Download", "Upload", "Connect", "Disconnect", "Install", "Uninstall", etc.
    Specify targets: Always mention what is being acted upon (e.g., "Click button named 'Sign In'", "Type email in text box", "Goto google.com").
    Keep order intact: Maintain the logical sequence of steps.
    No explanations or conversational filler in the output.

    Output Format:
    A numbered list, with each item representing a single, distinct action.
    Start each line with the action verb.

    Example:
    Input Text:
    "To sign in to Google, navigate to google.com and click the 'Sign in' button, usually found in the top right corner. Then, enter your Google Account email or phone number and password which you set up earlier."

    Output:
    1. Goto google.com
    2. Click button named "Sign In"
    3. Type email or phone number in text box
    4. Press Enter
    5. Type password in text box
    6. Press Enter
